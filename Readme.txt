Hi dear friend,
My name is Davoud Badamchi, I've got my master in Computer Software Eng. from Tabriz University in 2016. Here is my thesis title and its implementation source code in Matlab. 

My thesis title is:
Clustering mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) with heuristic algorithms.
I implemented Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Bacterial Conjugation operator (BC) for clustering MWSNs. The result of BC operator was relativey promising. I am poblishing this source code for other students who wants to work on either WSNs or MWSNs areas. I hope it helps.

Best wishes.
D.B
